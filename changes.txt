Introduction
------------

  * Introduction changed.

Background theory
-----------------

  * Removed most of the quotes, rewritten.
  * Condense the itemized key-principles.

Development process and technology stack
----------------------------------------

  * Brainstorming Section re-written, additional focus on platform.
  * Lo-fi prototypes -> Design sketches
  * New sections:
      Sketch elements, affordances and signifiers.
      Layout and final design-sketches.
      Potential primary users
  * Hi-fi -> Sketch implementation
    * More condensed information about the application.
    * Test and task flows moved after implementation.
    * Test-task receive own section, receive less attention, superfluous content
      removed.

Evaluation:
-----------

  * Suggestion on what could be done in following iterations added to
    presented test-results.
  * Added section reflecting over test results as a whole and general ideas for
    subsequent iterations (Current results and subsequent iterations)

Discussion:
-----------

  * Discusses limited differentiation between design-choices presented during
    the interviews.
  * Discuss how more complex results could lead to dropoff in participation.
  * Added sections: "Reflection on the stated goals" and "Possible avenues of
    expansion".
