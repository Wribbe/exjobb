  \subsection{Why usability testing?}

    Initially, the plan was to make interface changes to the
    organization-software itself, but a question remained, how do you prove
    that it actually makes a difference?

    \todo{Describe why usability testing, add scaling problem.}

  \subsection{Introduction}

    Usability is traditionally done in person with the \textit{over the
    shoulder} method which gives a good insight of what a participant does
    during a test. Further more, if the \textit{thinking out aloud -
    method} is utilized correctly, the test-moderator should have a good
    insight into the participant thought-process during the test.

  \subsection{Evolution and current use}

    While effective\checkTruth this method scales poorly with a one to one
    ratio between moderator and test participant. This project investigates
    the possibility of alleviating this scale constraint by utilizing a
    internet based platform to conduct usability tests of user interfaces
    online.
