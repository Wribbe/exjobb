\section{The development process}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item{Discuss the process. Good bad? Done anything differently?}
  \end{itemize}

\section{Results}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item{Discuss the results.}
    \item{Anything weird?}
    \item{Everything as planned?}
    \item{Outliers, why?}
  \end{itemize}

\section{Possible improvements}

  What could be improved if this was done again?

  \subsection{Multiple design iterations}

    Should have had multiple smaller iterations, easy to get stuck.

  \subsection{Opt-in followup}

    Some questions reveled answers that didn't match what I had
    anticipated, would be interesting to at least have a chance to follow
    up on those observations.

  \subsection{Leverage more frameworks?}

    Didn't have the foundational expertise to decide on a good
    framework, would be easier now.
    Build upon frameworks for faster iteration?

\section{Threats to validity}

  \subsection{Online testing and latency}

    Latency should be minimal, but it would be better to measure and
    verify than simply guess.

  \subsection{Seeding with user-id}

  Might be a quirk in that re-seeding with the same user-id could
  possibly create 'easy' anonymous id's.

  Not possible to check screen-size and input method.

%				network latency?
%				multiple runs with same person?
