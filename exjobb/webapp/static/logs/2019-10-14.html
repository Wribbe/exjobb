    <h2>2019-10-14</h2>
    <h3> General </h3>
      <p>
        Set up a larger test session with interviews using the hi-fi version
        somewhere between 25/11-29/11. (~20 people)
        <ul>
          <li>Draft blurb for Facebook request.</li>
          <li>Make poster draft.</li>
          <li>Ask Stoffe / Elias / Micke -- Company interview?.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Figure out theme-variables that could be combined for the tests.</p>
      <p>
        Test should resemble string of pseudo-managerial tasks:
        <ul>
          <li>Who has the largest number of assign hours?</li>
          <li>Who is available on this timeline?</li>
          <li>
            Is anyone blocked? Where? Could they be assigned to something else?
          </li>
          <li>Who has solved the most issues / tasks? Represent work-load as
            bubbles linked to the user?</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

    <h3>Deliverables</h3>
