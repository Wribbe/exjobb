          The Cinematic producer wants a at-a-glance readable overview of how much of
          each team members total work-time has been assigned to different tasks.
          Current design revolves around a light-weight webb-application created
          and hosted with <a href="www.python.org">Python</a> and <a
            href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/">Flask</a>.

          There are three systems that need to be accessed in order for the
          planned application to have the desired effect:

          <dl>
            <dt>HRTB</dt>
            <dd>
              Internal MASSIVE HR-tool that has data about contract-hours and
              vacation.
            </dd>
            <dt><a href="https://www.shotgunsoftware.com/">Shotgun</a></dt>
            <dd>
              Content management and task-planning software used to assign and
              track tasks.
            </dd>
            <dt><a href="https://atlassian.com/software/jira">Jira</a></dt>
            <dd>
              Issue tracking software developed by Atlassian.
            </dd>
          </dl>

          In a nutshell:
          <ul>
            <li>Pick a user.</li>
            <li>Figure out how many hours they have available based on contract
            and vacation.</li>
            <li></li>
          </ul>
