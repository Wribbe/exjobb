        <li>
          <span>What</span> -
          This test consists of abstracted representations of pseudo-managerial
          tasks, where the goal is to find a specific interface element as fast as
          possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Why</span> -
          The goal is to examine how different combinations of text, color,
          contrast etc. impact reaction times of users.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>How</span> -
          The server will keep track of when the task was started. When the
          taks is finished, the final time and variables used to
          generate the test-data are recorded.

      <ul>
        <li>
          The goal is to record as little, ideally no, personally identifiable
          information about the participants of this test.
        </li>
        <li>
          If identifiable patterns emerge they will not be included in any
          publicly distributed material.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any statistical reporting will be done in aggregate and
          not focus on individual test-results.
        </li>
